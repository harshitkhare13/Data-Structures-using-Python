Advantage of this data structure is that we can traverse in both the directions and for deletion we don’t need to have explicit access to previous node. <br>\n",

A circular linked list can be a singly circular linked list or doubly circular linked list. Advantage of this data structure is that any node can be made as starting node. This is useful in implementation of circular queue in linked list.<br>\n",

But the size of the array was fixed and it is already full so it can not add any new element. If we make an array of a size lot more than the number of subjects it is possible that most of the array will remain empty. We reduce the space wastage Linked List is formed which adds a node only when a new element is introduced.<br><br>\n",
